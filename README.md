# variety-discrimination-power （VDP）

# 1. Introduction
VDP is an Appraisal Index for Loci Combinations Screening Applied in Plant Variety Discrimination.VDP refers to the overall capability of a certain loci combination to distinguish all given varieties calculated by certain statistic method, based on the fact that the genotype of a loci combination can be used to identify a certain variety of plant. 
VDP contains three statistic methods, i.e. probability-based variety discrimination power (P-VDP), comparison-based variety discrimination power (C-VDP), ratio-based variety discrimination power (R-VDP). Total probability of discrimination Power (TDP) is a comprehensive capability appraisal index used to identify individual by multiple loci. In order to compare the calculation results of these methods, we developed the software call "VDP", which can calculate the value of TDP, P-VDP, C-VDP and R-VDP.
